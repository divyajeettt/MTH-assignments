# MTH201: Probability & Statistics

## About MTH201

**[MTH201: *Probability & Statistics*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=MTH201)** is a 2xx-level course offered to all undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. The course introduces students to [Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) and how it can be applied to [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics). It aims to:

- expose students to discrete and continuous [Random Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)
- enable students to apply Probabilistic models to solve application-based problems
- expose students to concepts like [Sample Mean and Covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_covariance) and [Expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)
- enable students to [Estimate parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory) of [Probability Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) and [Test Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) from random samples

## About the Programming Assignment

Students were given a set of problems to apply the concepts of Probability Models, mainly to experiment how different distributions look like and how their parameters affect the distributions.
