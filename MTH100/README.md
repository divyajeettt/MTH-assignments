# MTH100: Linear Algebra

## About MTH100

**[MTH100: *Linear Algebra*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=MTH100)** is a 1xx-level course offered to all undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. The course covers basics of [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) inlcuding matrices, vector spaces, linear transformations, and inner prodcuts. It aims to:

- provide a strong foundation in LA concepts to be used in future CSE and ECE courses
- enable students to solve [Systems of Linear Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) using applicable methods and results
- enable students to identify the truthness of statements involving [Vector Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and [Linear Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map)
- encourage students to construct proofs for statements using the results covered in the course

## About the Programming Assignment

Students were asked to prove or disprove whether a given subset of *Z-mod 2* is a subspace or not. The aim of the assignment was to allow students to apply the concepts of subspaces programmatically.
