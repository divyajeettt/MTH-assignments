# MTH100: Linear Algebra

## About MTH377

**[MTH377: *Convex Optimization*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=MTH577)** is a 3xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI and CSAM discplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course is centered around the [Convex Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization) branch of mathematics and its theory. It aims to:

- enable students to identify and solve convex optimization problems
- teach students to understand the structure of convex sets and functions
- encourage students to appriciate the [Duality Theory of Convex Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(optimization)#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20the%20optimal%20values,fact%20is%20called%20strong%20duality.)

## About the Programming Assignment

Students were given a set of problems from the optimization domain and solve them using programming.
